# Unit Testing using Mocha and Chai 
<small><b>[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)</b> is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.

<b>[Chai](http://www.chaijs.com/)</b> Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for Node.JS and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

<b>Unit Test (one type of automated test)</b> 
A single piece of code (usually an object or a 
function) is tested, isolated from other pieces

<b>Test-Driven Development</b> 
TDD or Test-Driven Development is a process for 
when you write and run your tests.

<b>Behavior-Driven Development</b>  
BDD or Behavior-Driven Development is a set of best 
practices for writing great tests. BDD can, and should be, 
used together with TDD and unit testing methods.

<b>Conclusion:</b>  
Unit Testing gives you the WHAT.
est-Driven Development gives you the WHEN. 
Behavior Driven-Development gives you the HOW.
"Although you can use each individually, you should combine them for best results as they complement each other very nicely."
